          <br />
          Happy birthday to my one and only beloved princess! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’– <br>
          It's your special day today! Ayang is finally 19 years old! :O <br> 
          I'm so lucky and grateful to have you in my life ayang! Every moment we spent together, gaming together, calls, our dates, even our arguments! I cherish all the memories we made and the experiences we shared.
          Each and every single one of them has meaning! <br> <br>
          I'm so happy to be with you ayang. There's not a single day that goes by without me thinking and worrying about you. You make me smile, happy, made me know what it feels like to be loved and made me a better person! <br>
        
        I love you to the moon and back!
